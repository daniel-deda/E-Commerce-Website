# e-commerce
Full-Stack E-Commerce Application built using ReactJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS, and MongoDB. (MERN stack)

To run the project, open 3 seperate terminals and follow the instructions below:

- **1)** In the frontend folder, run the command **npm start** to run the interactive front-end.
- **2)** In the backend folder, run the command **node .\index.js** to run the backend (server).
- **3)** In the admin folder, run the command **npm run dev** to run the admin panel where you can add and remove products, as well as view the product list.

_Note: You must run the backend folder before the admin folder because the admin panel relies on the server being up already._

Please let me know if you have any issues with the code or have any suggestions!
